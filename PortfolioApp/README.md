# PortfolioApp

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program.
This app reveals the power of using latest technology to showcase your portfolio in a more innovative manner, than the 
usual document based Resume.

*PortfolioApp* was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer.

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Showcase Android/Website based projects in one single place
* Add as much relevant projects as one can
* Impress People with a Disruptive Portfolio

## How to Work with the Source

You must provide your own Projects in order to build the app via Intent, else on clicking any of the buttons, you'd receive
a series of Toast messages.
